Experimental Setup:

We connected two laptops via an ethernet cable. It's bandwidth was 100Mbps.

How to run the code:
1. For compilation, run make.
2. For running server ./server-mp <port number>
3. For running client,
	./multi-client <server IP> <port number> <Number of threads> <duration> sleep-time> <random/fixed>

Client output format:

Done!
throughput = .... req/s
average response time = .... sec
